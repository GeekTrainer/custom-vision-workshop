## Prerequisites

### Python 3.8 or greater, including pip

To test if you have Python and pip installed, open a command or terminal window and run the following commands.

- [Linux](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/)

### Visual Studio Code

The instructions for this workshop assume you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open source code editor. You will also need the [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), which will provide additional functionality when writing Python.
